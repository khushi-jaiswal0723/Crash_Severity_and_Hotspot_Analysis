## 🚦 Crash Severity & Hotspot Analysis
### Headline:
Uncovering factors influencing injury severity and identifying high-risk road hotspots to improve road safety.

### 📌 Short Description:
A data-driven project analyzing crash datasets to explore how driver, vehicle, and environmental factors affect injury severity, while mapping geospatial hotspots of severe crashes to highlight dangerous locations.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack:

**Excel** → Data Cleaning.

**SQL** → Data aggregation and grouping.

**Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) → Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models.

**Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Data visualization of severity distributions and factor analysis.

**Folium** → Interactive crash hotspot heatmaps using latitude and longitude.

**Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** → Development and analysis workflow.

**GitHub** → Version control and project sharing.

### 🔹 Problem:

Severe crashes are a major public safety issue. Authorities need to understand which factors (driver, vehicle, environment) drive injury severity and where most severe crashes occur, so that targeted interventions can reduce risks.

### 🔹 Goals of the Project:

Identify driver, vehicle, and environmental factors influencing crash severity.

Build an ML model to predict injury severity.

Analyze severity across collision type, weather, light, and vehicle age.

Perform hotspot analysis with heatmaps to detect dangerous road segments.

### ✅ Recommendations for Policymakers & Road Safety Authorities:

Prioritize interventions on roads with repeated severe crash hotspots.

Enforce speed limits and introduce calming measures where severe crashes are concentrated.

Promote vehicle renewal policies as older vehicles show higher severe crash rates.

Focus traffic monitoring and awareness programs during high-risk hours.
